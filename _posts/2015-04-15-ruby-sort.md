title: Sorting in Ruby 
---

As promised in my earlier post, I will take a look at the built-in tools for sorting in Ruby, and contrast it to Python where relevant.
Much of this post is heavily inspired by the [Sorting Mini-HOW TO](https://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sorting/) on the Python wiki.

## Sorting Basics ##

## Key Functions ##

## Ascending and Descending ##

## Sort Stablity ##
Unlike in Python, the built-in sort function in Ruby is *not* stable: 
There is no guarantee that elements with equal comparison keys will appear in the sorted list in the same order in which they appeared in the unsorted list.

I did some digging to find out why this might be the case in Ruby, and it appears that this is due to the default Ruby sort implementing a variant of quicksort.

## DSU in Ruby ##
True to its inheriting a number of ideas from Perl, Ruby also borrows the term "Schwartzian transform".

## Maintaining Sort Order ##
