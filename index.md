Welcome to my GitHub page! I plan to use this as the prime locus for my essays on mathematics, linguistics, technology, and associated fields. I intend to gradually transfer my older writings on these topics (currently hosted elsewhere) to this site, so that I can use better tools (and Git!) to preserve and edit them.
